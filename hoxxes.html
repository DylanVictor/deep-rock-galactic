            Hoxxes IV is SO RICH IN MINERALS that our database of exploitable cave systems
            practically doubles on a weekly basis! But, thanks to the TIRELESS EFFORTS of the Research & Development branch,
            so too does our understanding of the extremely hostile flora and fauna found there. To prepare you for some of
            the risks that you’ll be facing on the planet, we have prepared a SMALL BRIEFING - we advise you to read it closely.

          <h2 class="section-title">THE MOST DANGEROUS PLANET IN THE GALAXY?</h2>
          <p class="section-paragraph">
            This is not hyperbole. DEEP ROCK GALACTIC has had their eyes on this awful rock for a long time, because it is
            so unreasonably rich in valuable and rare materials. The problem, however, is that it is also the home of one of
            the most dense and diverse collections of hostile alien flora and fauna ever encountered.<br><br> It is an ugly planet. A
            bug planet. A planet of plutonium-fanged worms that would like nothing better than to take up residence in your
            sinus cavities.<br><br> What we are saying is this: Hoxxes IV is a very bad place.

          <h2 class="section-title">WHY DWARVES?</h2>
          <p class="section-paragraph">
            While the operations of DEEP ROCK GALACTIC goes all across the spectrum when it comes to operating specs,
            there are some that absolutely stand out. And when it comes to the MOST DANGEROUS DIGS, we have long relied on
            the tenacity, strength, and sheer underground survivability of the stout DWARVES.<br><br> It is a simple fact of life -
            when you're attempting to establish a profitable mining operation on the most hostile planet in the galaxy,
            sometimes things don’t go to plan. And when all other measures have failed - a mine suddenly gone dark, or a
            particularly heavy alien infestation is uncovered - that is when we send in the DWARVES.
