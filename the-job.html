        <p class="teamwork-description job-description">
          At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we value TEAMWORK above all else! The sheer hostility of Hoxxes IV means
          anyone caught away from their team will be in for a world of hurt. As a responsible INTERPLANETARY MINING CONGLOMERATE,
          we depend on our employees to take care of each other. In other words - we wonâ€™t be there holding your hand. <br><br>
          As the saying goes: "Dig together - or dig your own grave".

        <p class="mining-description job-description">
          At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we specialise in SPACE MINING at the most dangerous dig sites in the galaxy,
          and we call upon those with a natural predisposition towards hard, honest work! <br><br>
          We believe in LEAN MINING, and we expect the same of you. Why send in a massive and costly mining operation
          when a CRACK SQUAD of highly-skilled mining operatives will do?

          At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we say that any cave can be conquered, so long as our drills remain fueled and
          lubricated! <br><br>
          While no two caves will ever be the same, our dedicated RESEARCH DEPARTMENT is constantly at work peeling apart
          the tectonic layers of the planet, locating the most lucrative caves and categorizing them accordingly.

          At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC we are big on PROMOTIONS! So big, in fact, that we tally up EVERYTHING you do and calculate your Rank
          based on that! <br><br>
          Upon first joining us, your Rank will be 0 (lovingly referred to as Greenbeards among the employees). You
          will not remain a Greenbeard for long, however - while your objectives will carry you ever further down, your standing
          within the company will only go up!* <br><br>
          * Provided, of course, you are fortunate and skilled enough to survive.
